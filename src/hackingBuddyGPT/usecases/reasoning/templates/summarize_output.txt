You are assisting with a Linux privilege escalation task.

The following command produced a long output. Summarize it by extracting only lines or entries that could help escalate privileges.

Include:
- Hidden or sensitive files (e.g., .bash_history, id_rsa, credentials, backups)
- SUID/SGID binaries, world-writable or misconfigured permissions
- Suspicious cron jobs, sudo rights, users, services, or scripts
- Any file, path, or permission that looks exploitable

Output the result in a style similar to terminal output (e.g., as filtered `ls -la` or `find` results).  
Avoid rephrasing unless it helps condense repetitive patterns.  
Do not include explanations â€” just the relevant lines or summaries that look like raw output.

Command:
${command}

Output:
${long_output}
